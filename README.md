# AlgoAndAILab_K-NN_MNIST
Project for the "Algorithms and AI Lab" Course of the 1st period (2024-2025).*

## Description

This project involves using the K-NN algorithm to predict number images from the MNIST dataset.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AlgoAndAILab_MathisDESAULTY.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd AlgoAndAILab_MathisDESAULTY
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script to start the prediction:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
2. Run the performance test:
    ```bash
    python performance_test.py
    ```

## Next implementations

For the moment, this project only consists of a main that gives statistics on the execution time and performance of the current algorithm. The next step is to create a user interface that will allow users to really understand the usefulness of this algorithm.
